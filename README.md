Lastly, we want to group the older employeers by which department they work in, this also helps to decide if hiring managers need new employees.

## Summary :
Many roles will need to be filled to replace the oder generations. There are enough retirement-ready employees ready to tutor the newer generation of workers..When we have the data, using SQL we can easily answer questions that we may have about the data. In this case questions about our employees, using SQL and can make future decisions based off what we receive. If we had more statistical knowledge, we could perform linear regression of time series analysis to analyze trends over the years and predict when the company should hire new employees.
